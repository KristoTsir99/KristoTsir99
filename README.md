- 👋 Hi, I’m Kristo Tsirakou, but feel free to call me Kris!
- 👀 I’m interested in Statistical Genetics, Psychiatric Genetics, Human Neuroimaging, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Debugging, troubleshooting, and error detection while coding fuel my motivation to keep trying to answer my scientific questions. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to analyze brain imaging, genomic, and metabolomic data as well as extract meaningful information from text corpora.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to identify the neural and genetic underpinnings of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases, such as autism and schizophrenia.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy writing poems about love, nature, and the inevitability of time passage as well as analyze my own texts on a semantic and sentiment level.
